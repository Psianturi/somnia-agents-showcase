# Somnia Testnet Network Analysis

## Gas Limit Investigation

### Block Information
- **Reported Gas Limit**: 4,500,934 (sufficient for deployment)
- **Current Block Gas Limit**: 0 (inconsistent reporting)
- **DeFi Agent Gas Requirement**: ~870,805 gas
- **Basic Agent Gas Requirement**: ~468,398 gas

### Deployment Results
✅ **Basic Agent**: Successfully deployed (lower gas usage)
❌ **DeFi Agent**: Failed deployment (higher gas usage + network issues)

### Network Issues Identified

#### **1. Forge Configuration Problem**
- Forge ignores `--rpc-url` flag in some cases
- Falls back to localhost:8545 connection
- RPC endpoint configuration not properly applied

#### **2. Gas Limit Inconsistency**
- Block reports different gas limits in different queries
- Possible network instability during deployment
- Transaction failures despite sufficient theoretical gas limit

#### **3. Contract Complexity**
- DeFi Agent has more complex logic than Basic Agent
- Additional events and state variables increase gas usage
- Constructor with parameters adds deployment overhead

## Recommendations

### **Immediate Solutions**
1. **Use Basic Agent Template**: Proven to work reliably
2. **Simplify DeFi Logic**: Reduce contract complexity for deployment
3. **Manual Deployment**: Use cast commands instead of forge create

### **Network Considerations**
- Somnia testnet may have deployment limitations
- Consider deploying simpler contracts first
- Test with minimal viable contracts

### **CLI Improvements Needed**
1. Better RPC URL handling in forge commands
2. Gas estimation before deployment
3. Network compatibility checks
4. Fallback deployment strategies

## Current Status
- ✅ **Basic Agents**: 2 successfully deployed and tested
- ✅ **CLI Functionality**: All Phase 2 features working
- ✅ **End-to-End Demo**: Complete workflow validated
- ⚠️ **Complex Contracts**: May need network-specific optimizations
